To run two letter file name as one in shell command e.g file name = file\ name (The \ terminates the whitespace and run it as a single command)
### Pipeline or Pipe <br>Is the ability to combine two commands together as one e.g. cut -c1 | tr -d "[:blank:]" (This combines commands cut -c1 - meaning cut first character and tr -d "[:blank:]" - delete all white space)
